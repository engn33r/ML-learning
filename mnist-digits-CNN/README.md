# Keras MNIST digits CNN

Used a Convolutional Neural Network with the MNIST digits training dataset to build a model. The model is then tested against the MNIST test dataset and 9 custom made images that I purposefully made a bit "difficult". The model does indeed make mistakes on the "difficult" custom images, perhaps because they are drawn in a different way than the original dataset.
