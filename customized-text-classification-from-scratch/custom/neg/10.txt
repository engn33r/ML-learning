What the?......

how could i have enjoyed Infinity war so much and find this to be a bunch of total incoherent crap? leave the Time Traveling to the experts like Dr Who. I wont even go into the all the plot holes and no sense paradoxes as i'm sure many have already done but what a sad ending to a wonderful journey? and please Disney, please lay off on the Wokey preaching crap its getting tedious, lets just have a good story eh and leave the politics to the Politicians?
