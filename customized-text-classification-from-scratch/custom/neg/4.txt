Soulless junk. The first act promised a serious take on the nature of revenge but the movie quickly gave up on interesting thematic and became a senseless mess.

I didn't care for a single character, the action was a confusing mess and the new characters do not give me much hope in the future of these Marvel films. On the plus side, this may mean diminishing returns on future instalments in this "cinematic universe" which would be great news for original films that aren't getting screened theatrically from the many megaplex screens being eaten up by this cynical capitalist trash. But hey... maybe the kids like it?
