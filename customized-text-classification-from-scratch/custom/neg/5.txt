After infinity war which IMO is the best of all the avenger movies, I was really looking forward to the conclusion.

Well, what a disappointment. The story made no sense at all. There was no character progression with Thor almost non existence! How can this be with him being the almighty god of thunder commanding the bi-frost in infinity war?!

That pace or the movie was slow and boring, the acting lethargic with a real lack of fun.

I found myself forwarding large chunks of this movie just to get to something good!

The ending was a total shambles and pathetic! Total Hollywood cheese which really didn't work.

They will no doubt make another Captain America movie so why end it like that? Passing the title of CA to someone else when they don't even have superpowers?!!

The more I think about it the worse it is.

Just a money making ending with no thought or direction.

Should have left it with infinity war.
