When you see a movie with a 8.5 rating then it must be brilliant. Sadly not the case here. This movie is hugely overrated. I've seen all the previous movies and they have all been great and I understood them. This one I was scratching my head thinking what on earth is going on? The plot was an incoherent ambling mess....too many characters, no flow or direction. This looked like a movie edited from bits of previous movies. I'm surprised this is rated so highly....I'm very disappointed that this was a lazy movie....a waste of 3 hrs.
