After Infinity War I was expecting Endgame to be the best movie made for all time, but it seemed like Infinity War was so great that the producers ran out of good material for Endgame. So instead of another decently awesome Marvel movie they went polar opposite to Infinity War and decided to make the worst movie possible. They chose to destroy the foundation of each of the main Avenger characters and prop up the secondary characters as the heroes in order to share the screen or be politically correct or something silly like that. And can we please stop making movies about time travel. It's stupid and impossible to do correctly and impossible in general so just ditch the idea! There's a lot more I could say but it's been almost a year now and I just don't care enough to keep tearing this movie apart. Basically I'm done watch Marvel because of this movie.
