I watched this movie for a second time and didn't realize before half way through that I already had seen it. I grew up reading comics and I enjoy good movies based on such - but this is not a good movie. Iron man, Guardians and Ant man - all have great movies and the start of Avengers also brought something exciting. Endgame is boring, lacks imagination and feels like a neverending wait for it to end. The main problem is that they try to make it epic and over the top righteous - and succeed cutting all emotional ties to the audience. See it so you can talk of it, but prepare to fast forward, fall asleep or a me - forget that you have seen it.
