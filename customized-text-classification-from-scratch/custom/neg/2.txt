A Titan approach is required to restore order back to this ridiculously high film rating....

The first act is a series of cliches that does not inspire.

The second act is the ever reliable and cheap device of time travel to make everything ok again.

The third act is a few moments of sacrificial giving to pull on hearts strings via characters we have already grown to like.

And this ladies and gents is what happens when you properly invest in a franchise, you can basically get away with a crappy grab for cash and a last hurrah.

If it were not for the nostalgia and sheer enjoyment of seeing marvel characters in one fight scene this screenplay would have presented as written by high school kids.

But no, we have worse, virtue signalling Hollywood types, who are in an insular sound bubble that insist that girl power must prevail on the big screen. Once again the ticket buying fans of fly over states are treated like they don't exist.
